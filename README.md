## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I figured out how to make a colored overlay to put in front of an image element.

```css
.card__hero__overlay {
  position: absolute;
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  background-color: hsl(277, 64%, 61%);
  opacity: 0.5;
}
```

### Continued development

I'll be able to use the techniques I learned on this project to better introduce components of my future projects. Better layout and better responsive designs.
